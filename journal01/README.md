# Complaints for Microsoft Word on Surface

I have been using computers since I was in first grade. I am able to pick up new technologies quickly and understand 
them based on me seeing the same patterns over and over. 

I got a Microsoft Surface 2 Go recently for the desire to not have to purchase more notebooks, printer paper and printer 
ink. I got Microsoft Word on my Surface, and I desire to be able to use it open PDF and edit them to finish school 
assignments.

To begin working on an assignment, I downloaded an assignment PDF that my machine learning instructor gave me.
This usually works just fine and I am able to open the file in Microsoft Word and begin drawing on it using
the pen. This usually works great and I am satisfied with the ability to move the text down to make room for more
drawings.
